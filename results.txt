• The world's largest robot is a 3500 tons coal dragline with automated loading and unloading. 
• A robot for securing mine roofs after blasting by drilling and fastening them. 
• A pilot-less burrowing machine for mining underground in flooded gravels and sands where humans can't go. 
• A robotic drilling and blasting instrument capable of producing controlled caving.

5.5 EFFECTS OF ROBOTICS IN LABOUR 
               Robots improved productivity while lowering labor expenses. Much has been written on the emergence of robots and the 
economic consequences of automation. However, most research is prospective in nature, and predictions of future employment 
implications vary significantly, with some studies projecting that as many as half of all workers might lose their jobs due t o 
automation. Even less is known about how robots will affect employment, salaries, and employees in the future. Intensity of robot

method.  
5.3 EFFECTS OF ROBOTICS IN PRODUCTIVITY 
               Significant organizational improvements are obtained when digital technology is coupled with management and mindset 
adjustments. For example, advanced analytics and sensors are lowering cost of maintenance and downtime while improving 
productivity and chemical recovery. Robotics and semi -autonomous equipment are replacing humans in mines, red ucing demand 
and hazard. According to miners in Western Australia, autonomous hauling technology has improved output by 20%.

               Underground mining has always been difficult to coordinate since it is hard to know where people and assets are or how 
far they have advanced. It's becoming more realistic to combine off-the-shelf technologies with in-house solutions to create a system

- Labour markets: An increase substitution of human labour by auto -
mation/robotics will cause a reduction of labour demand from 
mining activity, affecting labour markets in mining regions and la -
bour mobility at the national level mainly due to a decrease in fly-in 
fly-out or drive-in drive-out (FIFO/DIDO) flows.  
- Income: Lower labour demand will provide fewer jobs with high- 
earning salaries typical in mining. A decrease in local wages will 
subsequently reduce the disposable income available in mining re -
gions, generating a diverse pool of indirect effects for mining com -
munities and the rest of the communities who send mining workers. 
We also include some insights on the implications of this on income 
and sale taxes.  
- Inequality across and between regions: A decrease of high-earning 
jobs will likely shift the median salary of mining regions to the

techniques from other industries (e.g., from manufacturing robotics). In the mining, miners have reported difﬁculties ﬁnding the 
skilled labor needed to support their operations. The newest generation of workers is technologically astute, but holds a di fferent 
attitude towards physical labor than previous generations. Robotization may be what is needed to entice this new generation i nto 
mining. Modern mining firms and equipment suppliers are required to be environmentally and socially responsible. The alleviation 
of emissions (e.g., through the coordination and optimization of ﬂeets) or reduction in power consumption by reduced operatin g 
demands (e.g., ventilation support) might be realized by way of real time monitoring and automation of equipment.
